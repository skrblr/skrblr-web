Editors Note: For the most part, this is going to be the same thing you can read at the spawn. But we might as well have a refresher for those of you who need it. There are other things that will be in his document, but it will be mostly obvious things. Though I will get more in depth than the spawn does. This is more for the aspiring newcomer than the seasoned skrblr veteran, but that doesn't mean you can't learn anything here, so take a look.

<br />
<br />

<ol>
<li>Don't ask about a promotion, and this goes for all of you, not just defaults. I understand you want to do what you need to take another step up in the ranks, but all you're doing is annoying us and lowering your chances.
If it gets to the point of harrassment, don't be surprised to wind up banned.</li>

<li>Spammers will be banned. Plain and simple. I'm not talking about 3-4 lines of random text. I understand that you guys can be crazy sometimes. But if you're asked to stop and you don't, you're banned, nothing else to it. When it comes down to it though, just don't spam. It's easier for all of us. (Side note: Speaking in caps lock is almost as bad as constant spamming. Don't do that.) </li>

<li>Do not beg for items. You can ask for an item, sure, but if the donator says no, you aren't getting anything. And please, ask nicely. "GIVE ME DIAMONDS" is a guaranteed way to not get what you want. Also, explain why you need something. It's easier for us to give hand outs if we know it's for a valid reason. If worst comes to worst, you'll be muted.</li>

<li>We're not going to change the time of day for you. And this doesn't only apply to builders, this encompasses everyone. Not even moderators can request this.</li>

<li>This next one should be common sense. Don't grief. AT ALL. We don't care why you're doing it. They could be your former spouse, who took the children and all of your stuff when they left, but you're not griefing them. Why would you be on the same server as them anyways? Point is, don't do it. We're watching you like a hawk. And I mean that literally, you can't hide from our anti-grief measures.</li>

<li>Don't steal, either. This kind of goes along with the last point, but don't take anything without permission.</li>

<li>Don't kill players "just because." If they're attacking you, fine, I'm not going to tell you to sit there and lose your stuff. If they griefed you, don't do anything irrational. Make sure you tell a moderator to confirm that they're the griefer before you kill them. Feel free to arrange a fight or competition between players, but otherwise, you're done. Unless of course the person you kill is a very forgiving person. (Side note: Mods can use "mob disguise," so watch out when you're killing a chicken or sheep that came out of nowhere in an urban area. It's probably not a mob.)</li>

<li>Don't whine. We all have rough times, but sarcasm isn't necessarily an unknown presence here. If you complain, chances are it's only going to get worse.</li>

<li>Respect other people. Chances are, other people will start to respect you.</li>

<li>Pay attention to ongoing conversations as best as possible. That's how you learn.</li>

<li>Don't advertise, ever. Censor server names if you have to mention another server. If you want to tell your friends about your cool new server, do it in a private message. And when I say friend, I mean friend, not everyone in the game at that time. That's no better than saying it publicly.</li>

<li>You will have to pass a test to be welcomed on, but you'll go through that when you get there.</li>

<li>Be mature. Chances are, you probably found the server on one of the listing websites, and the description would have said exactly this. We prefer older players, that's no secret. But if you are young and/or immature, be aware that most people on the server (specifically the moderators) are not going to think the same way you do, so use discretion. Also be aware that no one on the server has to hold back on anything "naughty," except for in the most extreme cases, such as a direct insult that could be mocking one's race.</li>

<li>Use common sense. Most of these rules should be obvious to you. If they aren't, you probably aren't what we want on skrblr. We all make mistakes, but at least attempt to think before you leap.</li>

<br />
Finally, a list of ranks for your convenience:
<br />
<br />
Red - Default; This person can't interact at all, excluding only the chat bar and basic movement. <br />
White - Builder; This person can do everything you could in vanilla singleplayer, and can also set homes. <br />
Yellow - Trusted; This person can do anything Builders can, and can warp. They are trusted by moderators. <br />
Aqua/Teal - Donator; This person donated money, and has extra privlages, i.e. item spawning. <br />
Green - Moderator; This person has exhibited extreme amounts of loyalty, and can ban, promote, and hawkeye. <br />
Purple - Giver/Supermod; This person has met requirements for both donator and moderator, and can use both. <br />
Pink - "Princess"; This title is currently only available to Voiceless_Sage. <br />
Gold - "Second in Command"; This title is only available to ItBePuddles, for extreme devotion. <br />
Blue - Administrator; This is Vikki, the server owner. What she says, goes. <br />

<br />
You are now more prepared than you will ever be. Welcome to the server.
