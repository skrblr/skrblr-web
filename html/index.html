<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
skrblr.net is dedicated to supplying a mature and intelligent community for Minecraft players to cooperate, and in some cases, compete in together. Our team of moderators is working vigorously, at nearly any time of day, to make sure everything goes well. This is not a team that just cheated its way to success: we all care about the server and invest vast amounts of time to ensure its well-being. We are blunt, but friendly. Help is just around the corner whenever you need it, and we are devoted to making sure your experience is great and above what you will get at other servers. Here, you are a member of the community, not an onlooker of a seclusive society. So enjoy: The road ahead is long and rough, but for every bump you encounter there will be assistance.
